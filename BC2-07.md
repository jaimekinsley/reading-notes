### A Conversation about REST with my brother

* The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.  
* A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts.  
* URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.  
* There's this concept of “Web Services” or "APIs". It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.  
* There's a powerful concept in programming and CS theory called “polymorphism”. That's a geeky way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them.  
* Many people to assume that HTTP is just for GETing. But HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.
