### mongoose instance methods
https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods

* Instances of Models are documents.
* Documents have many of their own built-in instance methods (https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/document.html).

### mongoose static methods
https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#statics

* You can also add static functions to your model.
* Do not declare statics using ES6 arrow functions (=>). Arrow functions explicitly prevent binding `this`.

### mongoose middleware
https://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html

* Middleware (also called pre and post hooks) are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous functions.
* Middleware is specified on the schema level and is useful for writing plugins.
