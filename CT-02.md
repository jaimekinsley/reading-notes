### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
* Better program design and higher code quality - because all of the mistakes and errors are already taken into account. The code is very simple, straightforward and brief, i.e. no massive code blocks the stall functionality.
* Detailed project documentation - the test contains a strict and detailed specification.
* TDD reduces the time required for project development - it allows fast identification of any issues because of the fast feedback. When tests fail when they should pass, developers know that something's wrong immediately.

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
beforeEach() runs a function before each of the tests in the file. It could be used to reset soem global state that will be used by many tests.

afterEach() runs a function after each on of the tests in the file. It could be used if you want to clean up some temporary state that is created by each test.

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
It necessitates a lot of time and effort up front, which can make development feel slow to begin with. Also, if the design is changing rapidly, you'll need to keep re-writing your tests. You could end up wasting a lot of time writing tests for features that are dropped.

### Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
Classes are a fundamental part of JavaScript, and ES6 classes give you syntax and inheritance that closely mimic those of OOP languages like Java. JavaScript still uses prototype-based inheritance under the hood, which comes with several corner cases, but extends behaves as you would expect with the exception of static properties. On the bright side, JavaScript classes are just variables, which means you can assign classes to variables and pass classes as parameters to functions without any special syntax.

### Name a use case for a static method
Static methods are called without instantiating their class and are also not callable when the class is instantiated. Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application. In other words, static methods have no access to data stored in specific objects.

One use is if we have a subclass to a parent class, any static methods that we declared are available to the subclasses as well.


### Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves
```
function greaterThan(n){
    return m => m > n;
};
let greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10);
console.log(greatThan10(11));
// true
```
This function allows us to create a new function. It allows the function to be reused with a lot of different inputs.



## Vocabulary Terms

Term | Definition
-----| ---------
functional programming | The process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.
pure function | A function that given the same inputs, always returns the same output and has no side-effects.
higher-order function | A function that operates on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
immutable state | State that cannot be changed.
object | An instance of a class where object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
object-oriented programming (OOP) | A computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.
class | A blueprint that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind.
prototype | A rudimentary working model of a product or information system, usually built for demonstration purposes or as part of the development process.
``super`` | The keyword that is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
inheritance | A mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of another object.
constructor | A special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class.
instance | One occurrence of a class or object.
context | A structure or instance or object that contains minimal set of attributes or properties or states that allows to execute or manage defined set of operations or tasks.
``this`` | A keyword that refers to an object, that object which is executing the current bit of javascript code.
Test Driven Development (TDD) | A software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.
Jest | A JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. with a focus on simplicity.
Contiuous Integration (CI) | A development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
unit test | A  software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
