## Responsive Web Design

* Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example. Being able to apply uniquely targeted styles opens up a world of opportunity and leverage to responsive web design.  
* The orientation media feature determines if a device is in the landscape or portrait orientation.  
* The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.  
* CSS3 introduced some new relative length units, specifically related to the viewport size of the browser or device.

## What is “Float”?
https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/

* In web design, page elements with the CSS float property applied to them are just like the images in the print layout where the text flows around them.  
* Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.  
* If you need text wrapping around images, there really aren’t any alternatives for float. But for page layout, there definitely are choices.
