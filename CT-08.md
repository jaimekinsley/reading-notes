### Mongoose Populate
https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html

* `populate()` lets you reference documents in other collections.
* Population is the process of automatically replacing the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s).
* The `ref` option is what tells Mongoose which model to use during population.
* ObjectId, Number, String, and Buffer are valid for use as refs. However, you should use ObjectId unless you are an advanced user and have a good reason for doing so.
* You can call the populated() function to check whether a field is populated. If populated() returns a truthy value, you can assume the field is populated.
* Mongoose populate doesn't behave like conventional SQL joins. When there's no document, story.author will be null. This is analogous to a left join in SQL.

### Express Routing

* Router is like a mini express application. It doesn't bring in views or settings, but provides us with the routing APIs like .use, .get, .param, and route.
* Since we defined server.js as the main file in package.json, that is the file that Node will use.
* We'll use router.use() to define middleware. This will now be applied to all of the requests that come into our application for this instance of Router.
* <strong>The order you place your middleware and routes is very important.</strong> Everything will happen in the order that they appear.
* Recap:
  * Use express.Router() multiple times to define groups of routes
  * Apply the express.Router() to a section of our site using app.use()
  * Use route middleware to process requests
  * Use route middleware to validate parameters using .param()
  * Use app.route() as a shortcut to the Router to define multiple requests on a route

### Mongoose Virtuals
https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html#populate-virtuals

* Using mongoose virtuals, you can define more sophisticated relationships between documents.
* You can also use the populate match option to add an additional filter to the populate() query.
* Virtuals are not included in toJSON() output by default. If you want populate virtuals to show up when using functions that rely on JSON.stringify(), like Express' res.json() function, set the virtuals: true option on your schema's toJSON options.
