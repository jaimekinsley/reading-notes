### Mongo Aggregations
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/

* The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines
* MongoDB provides the `db.collection.aggregate()` method in the mongo shell and the aggregate command to run the aggregation pipeline.
* In MongoDB, the aggregate command operates on a single collection, logically passing the entire collection into the aggregation pipeline.


### Aggregations by Example

* The first stage of the pipeline is matching, and that allows us to filter out documents so that we're only manipulating the documents we care about.
* Once we've filtered out the documents we don't want, we can start grouping together the ones that we do into useful subsets.
* The `$group` transformation allows us to group documents together and performs transformations or operations across all of those grouped documents.
