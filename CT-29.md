### MVC

* Model - The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
* View - Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
* Controller - Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
* Service - Between the controller and the model sometimes goes a layer which is called a service. It fetches data from the model and lets the controller use the fetched data.

* The guiding light of Model View Controller (MVC) is separating presentation from domain.
* Model is a  construct to contain your domain-specific data and logic. Ideally, a model would have no idea a UI even existed. For our purposes, don’t think of a model as “an instance of a class inheriting from a Model object” but rather “a collection of functions and objects that are specific to my app’s domain.”
