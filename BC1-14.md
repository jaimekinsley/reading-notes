(https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)  

*  One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations.  
* With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs.  
* Animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.  
* To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the `@keyframes` rule.
