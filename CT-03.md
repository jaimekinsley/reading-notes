### Why would a developer choose to make data models?
When a data model is implemented in a system, it solidifies and reinforces the rules that maintain data integrity--entity integrity and referential integrity.

Creating the entities and relationships in a data model is akin to defining the objects and operations in an organization. The implication here is that the people who create the data model are responsible for getting those definitions right.

### What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
The CRUD paradigm is common in constructing web applications, because it provides a memorable framework for reminding developers of how to construct full, usable models. A model should have the ability to perform at most these four functions in order to be complete. If an action cannot be described by one of these four operations, then it should potentially be a model of its own.

### What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
Postgres is SQL and MongoDB is NoSQL.

### What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Mongoose is a JavaScript library that allows you to define schemas with strongly typed data. Once a schema is defined, Mongoose lets you create a Model based on a specific schema. A Mongoose Model is then mapped to a MongoDB Document via the Model's schema definition.

Once you have defined your schemas and models, Mongoose contains many different functions that allow you to validate, save, delete, and query your data using common MongoDB functions.

### Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
A library application could have Title, Author, ISBN number. Each Title would have an ISBN number and belong to an Author.

## Vocabulary
Term | Definition
-----| ----------
database | Any collection of data or information, that is specially organized for rapid search and retrieval by a computer.
data model | A data model documents and organizes data, how it is stored and accessed, and the relationships among different types of data.
CRUD | The four basic functions of persistent storage (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).
schema | The skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated. It formulates all the constraints that are to be applied on the data.
sanitize | The process of deliberately, permanently and irreversibly removing or destroying the data stored on a memory device to make it unrecoverable.
Structured Query Language (SQL) | A standardized query language for requesting information from a database.
Non SQL (noSQL) | Databases that are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
MongoDB | A document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents.
Mongoose | An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
record | A group of related data held within the same structure. More specifically, a record is a grouping of fields within a table that reference one particular object. The term record is frequently used synonymously with row.
document | Where NoSQL databases keep data. These documents follow a minimum of standard format rules (so that the database can understand it for post processing). The format used could be JSON, XML, YAML etc.
Object Relation Mapping (ORM) | A programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.
