### An intro to Webpack

* Webpack is a static module bundler.
* Webpack goes through your package and creates  a dependency graph which consists of various modules which your webapp would require to function as expected. Then, depending on this graph, it creates a new package which consists of the very bare minimum number of files required, often just a single bundle.js file which can be plugged in to the html file easily and used for the application.
* ReactJS is a UI library which is very helpful in building intelligent complex UIs, and create-react-app is a CLI tool for setting up or bootstrapping a boilerplate dev setup to make React applications.

### Webpack Concepts
https://webpack.js.org/concepts/
* Webpack recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then bundles all of those modules into a small number of bundles - often, just one - to be loaded by the browser.
* By default the entry point is ```./src/index.js```, but you can specify a different (or multiple entry points) by setting an entry property in the webpack configuration.
