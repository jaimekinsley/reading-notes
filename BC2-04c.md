## JavaScript Asynchronous Programming and Callbacks
https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-callbacks/

* A callback is a simple function thatâ€™s passed as a value to another function, and will only be executed when the event happens.   
* Every callback adds a level of nesting, and when you have lots of callbacks, the code starts to be complicated very quickly.  
* This is solved with Promises and Async/Await.  

### Understanding JavaScript Promises

* Promises are one way to deal with asynchronous code in JavaScript, without writing too many callbacks in your code.  
* Once a promise has been called, it will start in pending state. This means that the caller function continues the execution, while it waits for the promise to do its own processing, and give the caller function some feedback.  
* At this point, the caller function waits for it to either return the promise in a resolved state, or in a rejected state, but the function continues its execution while the promise does it work.

* Promises are essentially a returned object to which you attach callback functions, rather than having to pass callbacks into a function.

* Promises make it easier to see what is going on, we only need a single `.catch()` block to handle all the errors.
