I really wish there was time to really read each of these chapters in depth, but it is nice to skim and see that things are starting to look familiar.

In HTML Chapter 2 - it got me thinking a lot about semantic mark-up's. I realize now that I've been using <strong> when I should be using <b>. I understand how it would be different for a screenreader. There's also so many extra things that can be embedded, like citing sources. I wonder if that is mostly for the developer to use later, and not for the benefit of screenreaders.

In HTML Chapter 4 - I got lost in the CSS Selectors, so I will try to spend more time there. 
Took note of the !important after property values to make it override other values.

In JS Chapter 2 - I forgot about var from our pre-work, since we've been  using most const. I want to dig into the differences.

In JS Chapter 4 - I liked the opening framework of Evaluations, Decisions, and Loops. I think I need to spend more time thinking about what the code is actually doing in plain English.
Took note of the && for multiple conditions. I needed that the other day.
