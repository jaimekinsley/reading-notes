### HTML Chapter 15

<b>Normal flow</b> - every block-level element appears on a new line. Default behavior.
<b>Relative positioning</b> - Moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow and does not affect the surronding elements.  
<b>Absolute positioning</b> - positions the element in relation to the containing element. Taken out of normal flow and does not affect the position of the surrounding elements. Moves as the user scrolls.  
<b>Fixed positioning</b> - a form of absolute positioning that does not affect the surrounding elements and does not move when the user scrolls.  
<b>Floating element</b> - takes the element out of normal flow and becomes a block-level element that other content can flow aroud.  

Boxes can overlap when you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning.  
The clear property allows you to say that no element with the same containing element should touch the left or right hand sides of a box.
