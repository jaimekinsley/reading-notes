### MVVM Introduction

* Model − It simply holds the data and has nothing to do with any of the business logic.
* ViewModel − It acts as the link/connection between the Model and View and makes stuff look pretty.
* View − It simply holds the formatted data and essentially delegates everything to the Model.
* The application logic belongs in a separate class, which is often referred to as the model.
* the model is entirely concerned with matters of what the application does, and not with how the user interacts with the application.
* You normally want some other class sitting between the user interface and the model. This has two important roles:
  * First, it adapts your application model for a particular user interface view.
  * Second, it's where any nontrivial interaction logic lives, and by that, I mean code required to get your user interface to behave in the way you want.

* Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform.
