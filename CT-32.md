### react custom hooks
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html
* Traditionally in React, we’ve had two popular ways to share stateful logic between components: render props and higher-order components.
* Hooks solve many of the same problems without forcing you to add more components to the tree.
* Just like in a component, make sure to only call other Hooks unconditionally at the top level of your custom Hook.
* Every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated.
* The need to manage local state with a reducer in a complex component is common enough that we’ve built the useReducer Hook right into React.
