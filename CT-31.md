### hooks api
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html
* `useState` is a Hook. Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.
* Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.
* Its called inside a function component to add some local state to it.
* `useState` returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.
* It’s similar to this.setState in a class, except it doesn’t merge the old and new state together.
* The array destructuring syntax lets us give different names to the state variables we declared by calling useState.
* The Effect Hook, `useEffect`, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API.
* Rules: Only call Hooks at the top level. Only call Hooks from React function components.
