### Express

* `supertest` hits your routes as though your server was running without actually starting it.
* use `jest.mock()` to test just the interfact to the API, not the actual data. You can test the data when you write API tests, not web server tests.

### Express middleware explained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HOem0amlyg

* Middleware is any number of functions that are invoked by the Express.js routing layer before your final request handler is made.
* On our defined route Do Something first, then pass it along to the next function. Each time we will use the request/response objects of an HTTP cycle to Alter, End or pass to Next whatever it is we're handling.
* All middleware functions carry an optional `next` parameter which is needed when passing along the request to the next function in the chain.

### Using middleware
https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html

* An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.
* Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
* Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the app.use() and app.METHOD() functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase.
* Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().
* Error-handling middleware always takes four arguments. You must provide four arguments to identify it as an error-handling middleware function. Even if you don’t need to use the next object, you must specify it to maintain the signature. Otherwise, the next object will be interpreted as regular middleware and will fail to handle errors.
* Example:
```
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})
```
* Express has the following built-in middleware functions: express.static, express.json, and express.urlencoded

### ExpressJS - Middleware
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/expressjs/expressjs_middleware.htm

* This example summarizes how to use middleware before and after route handler; also how a route handler can be used as a middleware itself.
```
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

//First middleware before response is sent
app.use(function(req, res, next){
   console.log("Start");
   next();
});

//Route handler
app.get('/', function(req, res, next){
   res.send("Middle");
   next();
});

app.use('/', function(req, res){
   console.log('End');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### Routing
https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

* You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function.
