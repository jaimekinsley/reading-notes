### context api
https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html
* Context provides a way to share values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
* Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.
* If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.
* React.createContext renders a component that subscribes to this Context object that will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.
* Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
* The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by `React.createContext()`.
