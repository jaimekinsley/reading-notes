### setState explained
https://css-tricks.com/understanding-react-setstate/
* `setState()` is the only legitimate way to update state after the initial state setup.
* The reconciliation process is the way React updates the DOM, by making changes to the component based on the change in state.
* `setState()` should be treated asynchronously — in other words, do not always expect that the state has changed after calling `setState()`.

### Reconciliation
https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html
* React provides a declarative API so that you don’t have to worry about exactly what changes on every update.
* Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch.
* Rerender in this context means calling render for all components, it doesn’t mean React will unmount and remount them. It will only apply the differences following the rules stated in the previous sections.

### Typechecking With PropTypes
https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html
* PropTypes exports a range of validators that can be used to make sure the data you receive is valid.

### Snapshot Testing
https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing
* You can run Jest with a flag that will tell it to re-generate snapshots:
`jest --updateSnapshot`
* Inline snapshots behave identically to external snapshots (.snap files), except the snapshot values are written automatically back into the source code. This means you can get the benefits of automatically generated snapshots without having to switch to an external file to make sure the correct value was written.

### Shallow Rendering API
https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html
* Shallow rendering is useful to constrain yourself to testing a component as a unit, and to ensure that your tests aren't indirectly asserting on behavior of child components.
* The shallow API does call React lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.
* ShallowWrapper: The wrapper instance around the rendered output.

### Static Rendering API
https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/render.html
* `render` returns a wrapper very similar to the other renderers in enzyme, `mount` and `shallow`; however, render uses a third party HTML parsing and traversal library Cheerio.
* `CheerioWrapper` is a constructor that it is analogous to `ReactWrapper` and `ShallowWrapper` constructors.

### Full Mounting - enzyme
https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html
* Full DOM rendering is ideal for use cases where you have components that may interact with DOM APIs or need to test components that are wrapped in higher order components.
* Unlike shallow or static rendering, full rendering actually mounts the component in the DOM, which means that tests can affect each other if they are all using the same DOM.
