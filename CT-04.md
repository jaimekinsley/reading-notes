(I skipped the first few questions since they were duplicated from yesterday's reading)

### Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally
Scaling horizontally is done by adding more machines. It divides the data set and distributes the data over multiple servers, or shards. Each shard is an independent database. Instead of buying a single 2 TB server, you are buying two hundred 10 GB servers.

Vertical scaling focuses on increasing the power and memory, whereas horizontal scaling increases the number of machines.

### Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases
NoSQL is more flexible. If your data is not necessarily structured in a certain way, or if you have multiple sets of data that need to be structured in a way that a table could not easily support (ie: nested objects), NoSQL databases are a great option. They allow you the flexibility to structure your data in a way that makes the most sense for your application without needing to abide by the row/column format.

However, there's no way to join different sets of data. If you need to retrieve multiple sets of data then NoSQL requires that you makes lots of queries (which can also reduce the speed that you were initially saving by going with NoSQL).

### Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
Amazon's DynamoDB and Google's Cloud Datastore and Cloud BigTable.
