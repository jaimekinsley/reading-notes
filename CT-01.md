### Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
Running JavaScript inside a browser means you are interacting with Web UI (HTML and CSS components) which is displayed on a user’s screen.

Running JavaScript without/outside a browser means you are using node.js technology to execute your JavaScript code. This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs.

### What is the difference between a module and a package?
A module is a single JavaScript file that has some reasonable functionality.

A package is a directory with one or more modules inside of it and a package.json file which has metadata about the package.

### What does the node package manager do?
NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. NPM manages all the packages and modules for Node.js and consists of command line client npm. It gets installed into the system with installation of Node.js. The required packages and modules in Node project are installed using NPM.

A package contains all the files needed for a module, and modules are the JavaScript libraries that can be included in Node project according to the requirement of the project.

NPM can install all the dependencies of a project through the package.json file. It can also update and uninstall packages. In the package.json file, each dependency can specify a range of valid versions using the semantic versioning scheme, allowing developers to auto-update their packages while at the same time avoiding unwanted breaking changes.

### Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module

__An anonymous function__

```
module.exports = function (msg) {
    console.log(msg);
};
```

__Export a function as a class__
```
module.exports = function (firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.fullName = function (){
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
}
```
__Load Module from Separate Folder__
```
var log = require('./utility/log.js');
```

Term | Definition
---- | ----------
ecosystem | A collection of software projects, which are developed and co-evolve in the same environment. It's also the community and resources available around a platform - people, forums, companies, products, code repositories, conferences, documentation, etc.
Node.js | Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.
V8 Engine | V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. V8 was first designed to increase the performance of JavaScript execution inside web browsers. In order to obtain speed, V8 translates JavaScript code into more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter.
module | A module is a software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines. One or more independently developed modules make up a program. An enterprise-level software application may contain several different modules, and each module serves unique and separate business operations.
package | A package is a collection of functions written for use in a single language and bundled with documentation. For many programming languages, there are software repositories where people share such packages.
node package manager (npm) | npm is the world's largest Software Registry. Open-source developers use npm to share software and many organizations use it to manage private development. All npm packages are defined in files called package.json and the content is written in JSON.
server | A server is a computer that provides data to other computers. It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet. Many types of servers exist, including web servers, mail servers, and file servers. Each type runs software specific to the purpose of the server.
environment | The set of facilities, such as operating system, windows management, database, etc., that is available to a program when it is being executed by a processor.
interpreter | A computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.
compiler | A a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language).
