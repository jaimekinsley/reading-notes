https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/

Steps:
1. Read the problem completely twice.
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
1. Optimize the real code.

70% of the time should be spent on steps 1-3

Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:

* Create a list
* Sort a list or array
* Create a map or dictionary
* Loop through a list, or dictionary
* Parse strings
* Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

* The best way to solve problems involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

Steps:
1. Understand - know exactly what is being asked.
1. Plan - don't dive right into solving without a plan.
1. Divide - don't try to solve one big problem, break it into sub-problems.
1. Stuck? - debug, reassess or start anew, and research.
1. Practice - https://coderbyte.com/


### The 5 Whys and Hows
https://asq.org/quality-resources/five-whys

* The five whys are used for drilling down into a problem and the five hows are used to develop the details of a solution to a problem.
* How to:
1. Draw a box at the top of a piece of flip chart paper and clearly write down the problem or solution to be explored.
1. Below the statement box draw five lines in descending order.
1. Ask "why" or "how" five times and write the answers on the lines drawn from number one to five.
1. It may take less or more than five times to reach the root cause or solution.
