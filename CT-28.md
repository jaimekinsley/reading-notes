### Architectural Styles and Architectural Patterns

* The popular Model-View-Controller structure (MVC) is a Layered architecture. Most of the time, we have four layers:
  * Presentation layer or UI layer
  * Application layer or Service layer
  * Business logic layer or Domain layer
  * Data access layer or Persistence layer
* The Event-Drive pattern organizes a system around the production, detection and consumption of events.
* Domain Drive Design is an object-oriented approach. Here, the idea is to design software based on the Business Domain, its elements and behaviors, and the relationships between them.


### Container and Presentation Pattern
https://alchemycodelab.github.io/fsjs-notes/05_react/patterns/container_presentation/
* containers : are stateful components that contain your business login
* presentations : are stateless components that present your data


### Container Details
https://alchemycodelab.github.io/fsjs-notes/05_react/patterns/container_presentation/container-details
* In class components:
  * Independent state changes (changes that donâ€™t rely on knowing what the current state is) are done by passing an object to `this.setState`.
  * Dependent state changes (changes that do rely on knowing what the current state is) are done by passing a function to `this.setState`. That function receives current state and returns an object for update.
* If your component always needs to fetch some data, you can use componentDidMount to fetch your data right as your component is mounted.
* If your component needs to fetch data based on some user interaction, prop change, or state change you can use the componentDidUpdate lifecycle method.
* In order to handle side effects react provides the useEffect hook. useEffect takes two arguments: 1. a function that preforms the side effect; 2. an array of values that, when changed, trigger the side effect.

### Presentation Details

* Presentational components are written as functional components. They return the markup that is going to get rendered to the DOM.

### functional vs class components

* A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.
  * You can now use the useState hook to use state in your functional components.
  * You can now use the useEffect hook to use lifecycle events in your functional components.  
* A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element.
