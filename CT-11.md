### User Modeling
* A users password, should be encrypted using a hashing algorithm before it is ever stored. this prevents anyone (including developers with database permissions) from ever getting access to their password.

### Cryptography
* Cryptography is the science which studies methods for encoding messages

### Hash Algorithms
* A Cryptographic Hash Algorithm takes a piece of data and produces a hash that is deliberately difficult to reverse.
* A hash password can be stored when the user signs up. When the user needs to login, they can resend their password and the server can hash the login password using the same hash algorithm. The server can then compare the hashed login password with previously stored hashed password to determine if the user should be authenticated.

### Cypher Algorithms
* A Cryptographic Cypher Algorithm takes a piece of data and a key and produces encrypted data. Later the encrypted data can be reversed into the original data by decrypting it using the same key.
* User tokens can be created by associated a random unique string (tokenSeed) with a user account and, in turn, encrypting the tokenSeed with a secret key that only the server knows.

* The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
