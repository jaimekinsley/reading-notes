### Why you should use bcrypt

* A one-way hash password has a hashing algorithm applied to it to make it more secure.
* A ‘salt’ adds a very long string of bytes to the password. So even though a hacker might gain access to one-way hashed passwords, they should not be able to guess the ‘salt’ string.
* A random ‘salt’ string could be added for each user, created on the generation of the user account. This will increase encryption significantly as hackers will have to try to find a password for a single user at a time.
* BCrypt is able to adjust the cost of hashing. With Key Factor changes, the hash output can be influenced. In this way, BCrypt remains extremely resistant to hacks, especially a type of password cracking called rainbow table.

### Understanding bcrypt

* `BCrypt` combines the expensive key setup phase of Blowfish with a variable number of iterations to increase the workload and duration of hash calculations.
* The largest benefit of bcrypt is that, over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower allowing bcrypt to scale with computing power.
* Another benefit of bcrypt is that it requires a salt by default.
* A function called EksBlowfishSetup is setup using the desired cost, the salt, and the password to initialize the state of eksblowfish.
* The resulting hash is prefixed with `$2a$`, `$2y$`, or `$2b$`. The prefixes are added to indicate usage of `bcrypt` and its version.

### Where to store JWT

* If your app needs to call APIs on behalf of the user, Access Tokens and (optionally) Refresh Tokens are needed. These can be stored server-side or in a session cookie.
* Auth0 recommends storing tokens in browser memory as the most secure option.
* Using browser local storage can be viable alternative.
