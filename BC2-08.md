* SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.  
* A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.  
* In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query.  
* SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.  
* SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column in ascending or descending order using the ORDER BY clause.  
* In SQL, the database schema is what describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain.
